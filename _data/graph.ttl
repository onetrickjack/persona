I am currently looking for **Consulting**, **Full-Time**, **Part-Time**, or **Contract/Project Based** opportunities. I have a strong background in Software Development and Architecture with a passion for the whole design process culminating in **beautiful**, accessible, and functionally **human-centric** solutions.

I also strive to be a [T shaped generalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) who has a broad understanding of most fields and a specific skill-set for Information, Communication Systems. I've loved my time in VFX and would be happy working in that sector, but I also want to diversify by leaning into impactful industries and organisations.

This also facilitates a better understanding of user needs and an intuition for what solutions fit best.

Refactored a flagship product and reduced the codebase by 5 thousand lines.

While the project was running we had a few changes in Head of Pipeline. While this lead to a few jarring pivots, I was lent on the most to keep the project continuity going. One of my favorite parts was doing the [Product Analysis and User Stories](/persona/projects/Nexus_User_Stories). It required a lot of effort to locate, understand, and compile the workflows for certain tools but was well worth it as it showed that most people didn't have the full picture.

I learned that Product Management is all about maintaining [continuity](/persona/Topics/Continuity) in accordance to the Product's vision. If every person using or working on the Product is not perfectly aligned with that vision the project will fail in either delivery or unmet expectations. The better aligned folks are in the beginning the better (and cheaper!) the product will be.

I lead a team of 8+ developers to create a modern production pipeline from Core Components of the MPC pipeline. I coordinated with MPC teams from around the world to aid in the development of shared components. This helped ensure the delivery of the 3 concurrent shows booked for our first year of operation. I had to wear many hats in this role including Product Management.

I leveraged Confluence based Automation to capture User Needs and then wrote some connecting code to manage our Jira backlogs. Prioritization was key, but ensuring artists and Supervisors felt they were being heard was even more crucial. Most stories didn't get actioned, but many got put on the shelf and that was often enough to keep most people happy.
