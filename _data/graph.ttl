Worked on product [strategies](/persona/Topics/Strategy#managing-model-hierarchy-manager-management) for a major [Pipeline overhaul](/persona/Projects/MPC_AMS_Touchpoints); we aimed to change from a static world-view to a more dynamically resolved loading paradigm. Refactored a flagship product and reduced the codebase by 5 thousand lines.

While the project was running we had a few changes in Head of Pipeline. While this lead to a few jarring pivots, I was lent on the most to keep the project continuity going. One of my favorite parts was doing the [Product Analysis and User Stories](/persona/projects/Nexus_User_Stories). It required a lot of effort to locate, understand, and compile the workflows for certain tools but was well worth it as it showed that most people didn't have the full picture.

I learned that Product Management is all about maintaining [continuity](/persona/Topics/Continuity) in accordance to the Product's vision. If every person using or working on the Product is not perfectly aligned with that vision the project will fail in either delivery or unmet expectations. The better aligned folks are in the beginning the better (and cheaper!) the product will be.

Retrofit the devops workflows for software deployment to improve workflows and improve system reliability. Helped address (massive) gaps in documentation which lead to Semantic Web research.

A lot of the research I did revolved around [data integration and warehousing](/persona/Projects/MrX_Data_Warehousing_Research). I was able to
pull Shotgrid and MPC AMS data into a plain text RDF and load into Dgraph to enable
GraphQL querying from a native database. The extensibility of the platform showed
volumes when I could also index the Mr X codebase and do regex search across the whole
stack within milliseconds.

I lead a team of 8+ developers to create a modern production pipeline from Core Components of the MPC pipeline. I coordinated with MPC teams from around the world to aid in the development of shared components. This helped ensure the delivery of the 3 concurrent shows booked for our first year of operation. I had to wear many hats in this role including Product Management.

I leveraged Confluence based Automation to capture User Needs and then wrote some connecting code to manage our Jira backlogs. Prioritization was key, but ensuring artists and Supervisors felt they were being heard was even more crucial. Most stories didn't get actioned, but many got put on the shelf and that was often enough to keep most people happy.

It was later adopted for ingesting pre-vis for Godzilla and then Megascan assets for Jumanji. We also did extensive work on scattering workflows leveraging a combination of USD point instancers and Alembic point clouds for rapid scatter update rendering.
