##### Mom-Dad
<br>
A stay-at-home dad where the mom is working full time.

Origins: When a kid needs to find something they say "Mom, where's my shoes?". But when the dad is the one at home they say: "Mom..er..Dad, where's my shoes?". The only difference is, Mom is still the only one who actually knows where their shoes are.
