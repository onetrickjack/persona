# Why is this guide necessary?

It is my humble belief that the VFX industry will continue to decrease in scale leaving many scaling up engineers high and dry. This creates two fundamental opportunities: new opportunities for scaling down engineers, and excellent engineers in scaled up companies and organisations outside of the VFX bubble.

Within this bubble lies a bunch of interesting terms that don't map well to well known info-industry terms. What follows is by no means comprehensive nor factual. It also doesn't likely generalize well across every studio as each have their own nomenclature as well so those descriptions will be rather "thingy-like".


# Nomenclature Mappings
## VFX to Information Industry


Pipeline -> A mixed bag of Data Lake, Supply Chain, CDN
AMS (Asset Management System) -> Data Warehouse
Editorial -> Client Interface for Ingress/Egress, CRM
DCC (Digital Content Creation) ->  applications, Vertical Integrations


## Information Industry to VFX Nomenclature

Data Lake -> Thing that makes directories with sensible permissions
Supply Chain -> Thing that gets assets from one person to another
CDN -> Thing that eventually gets final Shots to client outbox
ETL -> The thing that every DCC does
