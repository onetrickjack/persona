# Design

Design is often thought of as the process of making something beautiful. Recently I've heard it referred to more are more as the problem solving process. I found Rich Hickey's talk ["Design in Practice"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5QF2HjHLSE&t=1928s&pp=ygUScmljaCBoaWNrZXkgZGVzaWdu) to be the most informative and inspiring. It also felt like he wasn't trying to sell me some wonder framework that works in all cases. Following the talk I synthesized it into the following illustration describing the design process flow in regards to a rather contrived situation.
