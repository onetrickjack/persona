An `anyURI` value can be absolute or relative, and may have an optional fragment identifier (i.e., it may be an IRI Reference).

  #
  #     #  `date` represents top-open intervals of exactly one day in length on the timelines of `dateTime`, beginning on the beginning moment of each day, up to but not including the beginning moment of the next day). For non-timezoned values, the top-open intervals disjointly cover the non-timezoned timeline, one per day. For timezoned values, the intervals begin at every minute and therefore overlap. 
  #     # @return [RDF::Vocabulary::Term]
  #     attr_reader :date
  #
  #     #  `dateTime` represents instants of time, optionally marked with a particular time zone offset. Values representing the same instant but having different time zone offsets are equal but not identical. 
  #     # @return [RDF::Vocabulary::Term]
  #     attr_reader :dateTime
  #
  #     #  The `dateTimeStamp` datatype is _derived_ from `dateTime` by giving the value required to its `explicitTimezone` facet. The result is that all values of `dateTimeStamp` are required to have explicit time zone offsets and the datatype is totally ordered. 
  #     # @return [RDF::Vocabulary::Term]
  #     attr_reader :dateTimeStamp
  #
  #     #  `dayTimeDuration` is a datatype _derived_ from `duration` by restricting its _lexical representations_ to instances of `dayTimeDurationLexicalRep`. The _value space_ of `dayTimeDuration` is therefore that of `duration` restricted to those whose `months` property is `0`. This results in a `duration` datatype which is totally ordered. 
  #     # @return [RDF::Vocabulary::Term]
  #     attr_reader :dayTimeDuration
  #
  #     #  `decimal` represents a subset of the real numbers, which can be represented by decimal numerals. The _value space_ of decimal is the set of numbers that can be obtained by dividing an integer by a non-negative power of ten, i.e., expressible as `i / 10n` where `i` and `n` are integers and `n â‰¥ 0`. Precision is not reflected in this value space; the number `2.0` is not distinct from the number `2.00`. The order relation on `decimal` is the order relation on real numbers, restricted to this subset. 
  #     # @return [RDF::Vocabulary::Term]
  #     attr_reader :decimal
  #
  #     #  The `double` datatype is patterned after the IEEE double-precision 64-bit floating point datatype [IEEE 754-2008]. Each floating point datatype has a value space that is a subset of the rational numbers. Floating point numbers are often used to approximate arbitrary real numbers. 
  #     # @return [RDF::Vocabulary::Term]
  #     attr_reader :double
  #
  #     #  `duration` is a datatype that represents durations of time. The concept of duration being captured is drawn from those of [ISO 8601], specifically durations without fixed endpoints. For example, "15 days" (whose most common lexical representation in duration is `"'P15D'"`) is a duration value; "15 days beginning 12 July 1995" and "15 days ending 12 July 1995" are not duration values. duration can provide addition and subtraction operations between duration values and between duration/dateTime value pairs, and can be the result of subtracting dateTime values. However, only addition to `dateTime` is required for XML Schema processing and is defined in the function `dateTimePlusDuration`. 
  #     # @return [RDF::Vocabulary::Term]
  #     attr_reader :duration
  #
  #     #  The `float` datatype is patterned after the IEEE single-precision 32-bit floating point datatype [IEEE 754-2008]. Its value space is a subset of the rational numbers. Floating point numbers are often used to approximate arbitrary real numbers.

  #     attr_reader :float
  #
  #     #  `gDay` represents whole days within an arbitrary monthâ€”days that recur at the same point in each (Gregorian) month. This datatype is used to represent a specific day of the month. To indicate, for example, that an employee gets a paycheck on the 15th of each month. (Obviously, days beyond 28 cannot occur in all months; they are nonetheless permitted, up to 31.) 
  #     # @return [RDF::Vocabulary::Term]
  #     attr_reader :gDay
  #
  #     #  `gMonth` represents whole (Gregorian) months within an arbitrary yearâ€”months that recur at the same point in each year.

  #     # @return [RDF::Vocabulary::Term]
  #     attr_reader :gMonth
  #
  #     #  `gMonthDay` represents whole calendar days that recur at the same point in each calendar year, or that occur in some arbitrary calendar year. (Obviously, days beyond 28 cannot occur in all Februaries; 29 is nonetheless permitted.)
