## Description
This is a [Ruby][] implementation of a [RDF Dataset Canonicalization][] for [RDF.rb][].

## Features
RDF::Normalize generates normalized [N-Quads][] output for an RDF Dataset using the algorithm
defined in [RDF Normalize][]. It also implements an RDF Writer interface, which can be used
to serialize normalized statements.

Algorithms implemented:

* [URGNA2012](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-canon/#dfn-urgna2012)
* [RDFC-1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-canon/#dfn-rdfc-1-0)

Install with `gem install rdf-normalize`

* 100% free and unencumbered [public domain](https://unlicense.org/) software.
* Compatible with  Ruby >= 3.0.

## Usage

## Documentation

Full documentation available on [GitHub][Normalize doc]

## Examples

### Returning normalized N-Quads

    require 'rdf/normalize'
    require 'rdf/turtle'
    g = RDF::Graph.load("etc/doap.ttl")
    puts g.dump(:normalize) # Can also use :canonicalize

### Normalizing an abstract Graph/Dataset
    require 'rdf/normalize'
    require 'rdf/turtle'
    g = RDF::Graph.load("etc/doap.ttl")
    g_canon = g.canonicalize # graph with URIs, literals, and blank nodes canonicalized.
    puts g_canon.dump(:nquads) # Normalized, but not sorted

## Contributing
* Do your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms.
* Don't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line.
* Do document every method you add using [YARD][] annotations. Read the
  [tutorial][YARD-GS] or just look at the existing code for examples.
* Don't touch the `.gemspec`, `VERSION` or `AUTHORS` files. If you need to
  change them, do so on your private branch only.
* Do feel free to add yourself to the `CREDITS` file and the corresponding
  list in the the `README`. Alphabetical order applies.
* Do note that in order for us to merge any non-trivial changes (as a rule
  of thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), we need an
  explicit [public domain dedication][PDD] on record from you,
  which you will be asked to agree to on the first commit to a repo within the organization.
  Note that the agreement applies to all repos in the [Ruby RDF](https://github.com/ruby-rdf/) organization.
