<p/>

I am currently looking for **Consulting**, **Full-Time**, **Part-Time**, or **Contract/Project Based** opportunities. I have a strong background in Software Development and Architecture with a passion for the whole design process culminating in **beautiful**, accessible, and functionally **human-centric** solutions.

I also strive to be a [T shaped generalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) who has a broad understanding of most fields and a specific skill-set for Information, Communication Systems. I've loved my time in VFX and would be happy working in that sector, but I also want to diversify by leaning into impactful industries and organisations.
